# Unveiling Hidden Customer Segmentation Through E-commerce Purchase Patterns

**Overview:**

This project performs an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on e-commerce sales data to uncover hidden customer segments based on their purchasing behavior.  The analysis aims to identify distinct groups of customers with similar buying patterns, providing valuable insights for targeted marketing campaigns and improved conversion rates.  The project utilizes various data visualization and statistical techniques to reveal these segments and understand their characteristics.


**Technologies Used:**

* Python
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn


**How to Run:**

1. **Clone the repository:**  Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone <repository_url>`.
2. **Install dependencies:** Navigate to the project directory and install the required Python libraries using: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. **Run the analysis:** Execute the main script using: `python main.py`


**Example Output:**

The script will print key findings and statistical summaries to the console, providing insights into the identified customer segments.  Additionally, the analysis generates several visualization files (e.g., `sales_trend.png`, `customer_segment_distribution.png`, etc.) which are saved in the project's directory. These visualizations illustrate the identified segments and their characteristics, offering a visual representation of the analysis results.  The specific visualizations generated may vary depending on the data and analysis performed.


**Data:**

The dataset used for this analysis is not included in this repository.  Please provide your own e-commerce sales data in a suitable format (e.g., CSV) to run the analysis.  Ensure your data includes relevant columns such as customer ID, product purchased, purchase date, and purchase amount.  Adapt the data loading section in `main.py` as needed.
